# Hangman-Javascript
Hangman was a school project from Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola for the course Javascript1. 


Hangman is a little game playable in browser. Rules are as expected, guess a letter to see if its part of the word you have to guess, and see if you can guess all the letters before the man is hung.

The game is also playable by clicking the following link:
